# About Me
Im doing a degree in game development at Northwest Vista Community College. I am a hardcore gamer and I love playing video games on any console for hours on end until late at night. So, I hope I get to make a good game someday that everyone will talk about for many years after being released that is something everyone can enjoy.

Other than school, I love surfing going out in the ocean and trying to find that perfect wave. Every now and then I go around on my long board and it's the closest thing to surfing living deep in Texas. I am also into watching anime and reading manga when I want a break from playing video games or watching TV. Since I was a kid, I have been playing card games like YuGiOh and Magic.
